# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Provider Registry NPM Package**: Successfully completed and ready for publication (version 1.1.0)
- **Comprehensive Model Coverage**: 1,652+ models from 25+ providers with enhanced data quality
- **Web Application Integration**: Successfully integrated with provider registry package
- **Data Synchronization**: Implemented cross-provider model synchronization for enhanced data completeness
- **Pricing Data Enhancement**: 356 models enriched with Helicone pricing data
- **Icon System**: Complete icon coverage for all 1,785 models with Weights & Biases icon mapping fixed
- **Test Suite**: All 29 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Selection Mode Toggle**: Fixed selection limit issue by implementing dual-mode selection system
- **Select All Checkbox Control**: Implemented proper selection mode handling for all column creation paths
- **Selection Mode Reactivity**: Fixed useMemo dependency to properly react to selectionMode changes

## Recent Achievements
- **Selection Mode Toggle Feature**: ✅ Completed
  - Added `SelectionModeToggle` component with visual indicators
  - Implemented dual-mode selection: "Compare" (10 items max) and "Export" (unlimited)
  - Fixed selection limit logic to only apply in comparison mode
  - Added mode-aware toolbar actions and validation messages
  - **Select All Checkbox Fix**: ✅ Completed
    - Fixed `createColumnsWithSelection` to properly handle selection mode for all column sources
    - Ensured select all checkbox is disabled in comparison mode regardless of column source
    - Maintained individual row selection functionality in both modes
  - **Selection Mode Reactivity Fix**: ✅ Completed
    - Fixed `useModelTable` hook's `columns` useMemo dependency array
    - Now properly watches `options.selectionMode` changes instead of just the `options` object
    - Ensures columns are recreated when selection mode changes, updating checkbox state

## Next Steps
- **Testing**: Verify selection mode toggle functionality in browser
- **Documentation**: Update user documentation for new selection modes
- **Performance**: Monitor table performance with new selection logic

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Selection Mode Architecture**: Using centralized selection mode state with proper propagation
- **Column Creation Strategy**: Ensuring all column creation paths respect selection mode
- **User Experience**: Clear visual indicators and tooltips for mode switching
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining existing functionality while adding new features
- **React Optimization**: Using specific dependency arrays in useMemo for better performance
