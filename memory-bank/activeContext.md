# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing a script to fetch AI model metadata and organize it into provider-based directories, with each model as a separate JSON file.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank core files to document project context and requirements.
- Successfully implemented Llama transformer for the AI models downloader.
- Added support for 7 Llama models across 3 providers (Meta, Cerebras, Groq).

## Next Steps
- Continue extending the system with additional AI model providers as needed.
- Consider adding more detailed model information (pricing, context windows) when available.
- Monitor and update model data as providers add new models.

## Active Decisions
- Use model `id` as the filename for each JSON file.
- Organize files under `providers/{provider}/` directories.
- Ensure output is idempotent and easily extendable. 

## NPM Package: Unified Provider Registry
- Planning to create a new npm package to expose static provider/model data from @/providers.
- Interface will use Unified Provider Registry pattern.
- Plan and todos are tracked in `memory-bank/provider-registry-plan.md`.
