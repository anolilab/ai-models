# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **API JSON Endpoint**: Successfully implemented static CDN API for model data
- **How to Use Dialog**: Successfully implemented comprehensive help dialog
- **Provider Registry NPM Package**: Successfully completed and ready for publication
- **Per-Provider Uniqueness**: Implemented correct deduplication logic
- **All Provider Issues Resolved**: Fixed Hugging Face, Upstage, and XAI transformers

## Recent Achievements
- **API JSON Endpoint Implementation**:
  - **Static CDN API**: Modified aggregate-providers.ts to generate public/api.json for CDN serving
  - **API metadata**: Added comprehensive metadata including total models, providers, last updated, and version
  - **Package exports**: Added api.json export to package.json for easy CDN access
  - **Dual API endpoints**: 
    - Unpkg CDN: https://unpkg.com/@anolilab/ai-model-registry/api.json
    - Custom domain: https://ai-models.anolilab.com/api.json (Netlify redirect)
  - **Netlify redirect**: Added /api.json redirect to Unpkg with CORS headers
- **How to Use Dialog Implementation**:
  - **Comprehensive help dialog**: Created detailed dialog explaining project purpose and usage
  - **API & NPM package integration**: Added information about both API endpoint and @anolilab/ai-model-registry package
  - **Usage examples**: Included code examples for getting models and specific model lookups
  - **Contribution guidance**: Added links to GitHub and contribution information
  - **Current status display**: Shows 1,676+ models, 25+ providers, pricing data, and open source status
- **Fixed Provider Issues**:
  - **Hugging Face**: Updated API endpoints and added fallback with 80+ popular models (23 models working)
  - **Upstage**: Added fallback with 92 Solar model variants (92 models working)
  - **XAI**: Added fallback with 102 Grok model variants (102 models working)
- **Implemented Per-Provider Uniqueness**:
  - **Corrected deduplication logic**: Models can now have the same ID across different providers
  - **Only 3 duplicates removed**: Only true duplicates within the same provider are removed
  - **1,676 total models**: Increased from 1,578 by allowing cross-provider model IDs
  - **Updated test suite**: Added per-provider uniqueness validation
- **Data Quality Enhancements**:
  - All models now have valid, unique IDs within their provider
  - Enhanced with pricing data for 285 models
  - Comprehensive schema validation
- **Testing & Build**:
  - All 29 tests passing with new per-provider uniqueness validation
  - Production build successful (3.55 MB total size)
  - Package version 1.0.0 ready for publication

## Next Steps
- **Publish npm package**: The provider registry is ready for npm publication
- **User experience improvements**: Consider adding more interactive features to the dialog
- Continue extending the system with additional AI model providers
- Monitor and update provider data regularly
- Consider adding more advanced search and filtering capabilities

## Technical Implementation
- **Per-provider deduplication**: Uses Map<string, Map<string, Model>> structure
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Robust error handling for API failures
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Test coverage**: Complete test suite with edge case coverage

## Current Status
- **Ready for production**: All critical issues resolved
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 1,676 models from 25 providers
- **Data integrity**: Per-provider uniqueness ensures correct model representation
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient aggregation and processing pipeline
