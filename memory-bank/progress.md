## Provider Registry NPM Package ✅ READY FOR PUBLICATION
- **1,676 unique models** from 25 providers with per-provider uniqueness
- **Fixed data quality issues**: Resolved empty model IDs and duplicate entries
- **Enhanced with pricing data**: 285 models enriched with Helicone pricing
- **Comprehensive test suite**: All 29 tests passing with per-provider uniqueness validation
- **Production build**: Successfully builds with 3.55 MB total size
- **Per-provider uniqueness**: Models can have the same ID across different providers (e.g., "gpt-4" in OpenAI and other providers)
- **Only 3 duplicates removed**: Only true duplicates within the same provider are removed
- **Context Window Filtering Bug Fixed**: 
  - **Critical Issue Resolved**: searchModels function now properly excludes models with null/undefined context values when filtering by context window range
  - **Root Cause**: Previous logic only excluded models with context values that didn't meet criteria, but didn't handle null/undefined context values
  - **Solution**: Updated filtering logic to properly exclude models with null/undefined context when context_min or context_max criteria are specified
  - **Test Validation**: Previously failing test now passes, all 29 tests continue to pass
- **JSDoc Documentation Enhanced**:
  - **Complete Parameter Documentation**: Added @param tags for all function parameters
  - **Return Value Documentation**: Added @returns tags for all functions
  - **Detailed Descriptions**: Enhanced function descriptions to be more descriptive and follow proper JSDoc patterns
  - **Nested Object Documentation**: Documented complex objects like criteria.modalities with their nested properties
  - **Important Notes**: Documented special behavior like excluding null context values
  - **Consistent Formatting**: All JSDoc comments follow the same style and format
  - **Property Name Fixes**: Fixed property name mismatches (tool_call → toolCall, streaming_supported → streamingSupported)
  - **Code Quality**: Merged nested if statements to reduce complexity and improve readability

## Web Application ✅ INTEGRATED
- Modern React application with TanStack Router
- Data table with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Provider registry integration for model data
- **How to Use Dialog**: Comprehensive help dialog explaining project purpose, NPM package usage, and contribution guidelines
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Comprehensive test suite with Playwright E2E tests

## What's Left to Build
- **Publish npm package**: The provider registry is ready for npm publication
- Continue extending the system with additional AI model providers
- Monitor and update provider data regularly
- Consider adding more advanced search and filtering capabilities

## Current Status
- **All providers working**: Fixed Hugging Face, Upstage, and XAI transformers
- **Data quality optimized**: Per-provider uniqueness ensures correct model representation
- **Ready for production**: All tests passing, build successful, package version 1.0.0
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 1,676 models from 25 providers with pricing data
- **Critical bugs resolved**: Context window filtering bug fixed, all functionality working correctly
- **Documentation complete**: All functions have comprehensive and valid JSDoc documentation

## Known Issues
- None - all critical issues have been resolved including the context window filtering bug
